This Cathedral was built in 1296 and last<b> 175 years</b>! It is an iconic architect in early Renaissance. Until now, tourists from all over the world will still be amazed at it.<br/><br/>

        <h5 class="w3-center">Width	32 metres (105 ft)<br/>Longest 30 metres (98 ft)</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">  The existence of this bridge is a miracle. During World War II it was the only bridge across the Arno that the fleeing Germans did not destroy.There have been shops on Ponte Vecchio since the 13th century. Initially, there were all types of shops,including butchers and fishmongers and, later, tanners, whose "industrial waste" caused a pretty rank stench in the area. In 1593, Ferdinand I decreed that only goldsmiths and jewelers be allowed to have their shops on the bridge in order to improve the wellbeing of all, including their own as they walked over the bridge. As time goes by and the development of the economy, nowadays, most stores on Ponte Vecchino are famous brands and selling luxury goods such as Rolex.<br/><br/>

        <h5 class="w3-center"> Was founded in 1004</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">After visiting most of Florence’s famous scenery, we drove to an  monastery in the suburbs with an Italian pastor. The Badia a Settimo or Abbazia dei Santi Salvatore e Lorenzo a Settimo is a Cluniac Benedictine abbey in the comune of Scandicci, near Florence in Tuscany, Italy.That must be the most memorable part of the trip. When we walked out of the chapel,we witnessed the sunlight was reflected directly onto Jesus, which the pastor called “God’s beam of light”.<br/><br/>
