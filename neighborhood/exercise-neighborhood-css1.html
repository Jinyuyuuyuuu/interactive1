   Florence is one of the world most famous art capital in central Italy. Here is the birthplace of the European Renaissance.<br/>  Therefore, there are 40 museums and art galleries, more than 60 palaces, and numerous churches. Besides, one of the<br/>  five cathedrals of the world––Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore (in English “Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower”<br/>usually called Florence Cathedral )</b> and world’s first art academy––<b>Academy of Fine arts of Florence</b> are also located here.

   <br/>
    <br/>
   The weather in Florence is similar to San Francisco, just a little bit hotter.Summer is cool and winter is also not too cold.<br/> Therefore, many families in Florence do not have air conditioning. <br/>However, this year because of the global warming, the temperature in early June reached <b>40 degrees Celsius (104℉)</b>!

    Florence Cathedral is one of the largest churches in Italy, and its dome is the largest brick dome ever.Brunelleschi designed the rhythm of the space of the big dome as if a piece of music. When it was completed, a musician from Netherlands was extremely touched by the beautiful sense of variation. Hence, he wrote an orchestral piece for it and played it at the ceremony. This Cathedral was built in 1296 and last<b> 175 years</b>! It is an iconic architect in early Renaissance. Until now, tourists from all over the world will still be amazed at it.

    The existence of this bridge is a miracle. During World War II it was the only bridge across the Arno that the fleeing Germans did not destroy.<br/>There have been shops on Ponte Vecchio since the 13th century. Initially, there were all types of shops,<br/>including butchers and fishmongers and, later, tanners, whose "industrial waste" caused a pretty rank stench in the area. <br/>In 1593, Ferdinand I decreed that only goldsmiths and jewelers be allowed to have their shops on the bridge in order to improve the wellbeing of all, <br/>including their own as they walked over the bridge. As time goes by and the development of the economy, <br/>nowadays, most stores on Ponte Vecchino are famous brands and selling luxury goods such as Rolex.

  After visiting most of Florence’s famous scenery, we drove to an anonymous monastery in the suburbs with an Italian pastor. <br/>That must be the most memorable part of the trip. When we walked out of the chapel,<br/> we witnessed the sunlight was reflected directly onto Jesus, which the pastor called “God’s beam of light”.
