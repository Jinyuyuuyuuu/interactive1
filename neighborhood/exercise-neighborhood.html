   <font size="4">After visiting most of Florence’s famous scenery, we drove to an anonymous church in the suburbs with an Italian pastor. <br/>That must be the most memorable part of the trip. When we walked out of the chapel,<br/> we witnessed the sunlight was reflected directly onto Jesus, which the pastor called “God’s beam of light”.</font>
